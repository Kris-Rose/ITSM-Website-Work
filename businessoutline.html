                    <p align="center">
                         Infinity Hot will promote its services through partnerships with established businesses such as Bright Bowls. This business will help us advertise towards women, who like to feel refreshed and rejuvenated after a workout, with a delicious smoothie or acai bowl. We also do profit shares with sororities within the Dallas area that will help attract young women as new customers. Profit shares will include social media promotion on platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram that do not cost anything for the business.
